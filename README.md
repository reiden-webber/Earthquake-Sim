# Earthquake Simulator Project
Worked on from September 2022 - December 2022
Uploaded to GitHub (February 1, 2023)
## Setup
- Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Install Python and, if necessary, the `tkinter` library (instructions found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-in-windows/)).
## Premise
Earthquakes can provide a useful context for teaching or reviewing many basic physics concepts, such as sliding and static friction, forms of energy and conversion from one form to another, and the elastic properties of materials.
